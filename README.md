# Portfolio Starter (GitHub Pages)

A minimal, dark, and fast personal site you can host for free with GitHub Pages.

## Quick Start
1. Create a new repository named `USERNAME.github.io` (replace `USERNAME` with your GitHub handle).
2. Download this starter, unzip it, and upload all files to the **root** of that repository.
3. Commit and push. Your site will be live at `https://USERNAME.github.io` in a minute or two.

## Customize
- Edit `index.html`:
  - Replace **Your Name**, email, tagline, and links.
  - Update the About section and skills list.
- Edit `assets/projects.json` to add or reorder projects.
- Edit styles in `assets/styles.css` for branding (colors, fonts).
- Optional: Add a custom domain in **Settings â†’ Pages** and set a `CNAME` file with your domain.

## Local Preview
Just open `index.html` in your browser. No build step required.

## Tips
- Keep project descriptions short and outcome-oriented.
- Link to demos or GitHub repos.
- Use clear headings and consistent tags.
